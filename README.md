# mergeIntervals

# To do:

- Update insert() and delete() to keep the tree balanced on each new insertion or deletion
- Check if tree traversals can't be minimised further
- Update deleteInterval() to process lists of merged intervals stored in nodes
- Make sure variable names node vs. interval/self vs. root are used consistently
